# # Introduction to Neo4j
#
# What is `Neo4j`?
# `Neo4j` is a graph database management system developed by Neo4j, Inc. It is an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Neo4j with Python using the `neo4j` library.
#
#
# ## Learning Objectives
# - Understand the basics of Neo4j and graph databases.
# - Learn how to set up and connect to Neo4j.
# - Create, query, and manipulate data in Neo4j using Cypher.
# - Explore visualization techniques for graph data.
#
# ## Prerequisites
# - Neo4j installed and running on your system.
# - Python installed with `neo4j` and `py2neo` libraries.
#     * `neo4j` is library that serves as a python client to establish connection to
#        Neo4j database servers.
#     * `py2neo`
# - This is done through building the docker image. Refer `neo4j.API.md`

# # Setting up Neo4j
#
# Default Ports
# Neo4j uses the following default ports:
# - `7474`: `HTTP` port for Neo4j Browser and REST API.
# - `7687`: `Bolt` protocol port for database queries.
# - `7473`: `HTTPS` port for Neo4j Browser (optional, if HTTPS is enabled).
#
# These default ports cannot be changed dynamically. If we need to change, we have to do it through neo4j.conf

# ## Start Neo4j Server
#
# As discussed earlier, the default port for the `HTTP`, i.e, the database server is assigned to 7474

# +
# Install Neo4j.
# #!wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
# #!echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable latest' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
# #!sudo apt update
#
# #!sudo apt install neo4j -y

# !sudo neo4j start
# -

# ## Connect to Neo4j Server
#
# Now, we have attempt to connect to the database server and query on it. For this, by default, the port that is exposed for such operations is 7687. Therefore, we have to connect to this port for all the query related operations.

# +
# URI and authentication details.
URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
USER = "neo4j"
PASSWORD = "neo4j"

# Create a driver instance.
driver = nj.GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=(USER, PASSWORD))
driver.verify_connectivity()
_LOG.info("Connection established.")


# -

# ## Update Password of Neo4j database
#
# This is a mandatory step. The default credentials will be accepted as authentication while pushing changes to the database. Remeber that once changed, the updates are permanent and will only be reset in a clean reinstallation.


# +
def change_password(tx, current_password, new_password):
    tx.run(
        "ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD FROM $current_password TO $new_password",
        current_password=current_password,
        new_password=new_password,
    )

# Reconnect with the new password.
driver = nj.GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=("neo4j", "new_password"))
driver.verify_connectivity()
_LOG.info("Connection established.")
# -

# # Check the Neo4j graph

# +
# Connect to the graph database.
graph = pyneo.Graph(URI, auth=(USER, "new_password"))

# # Basic Concepts
#
# In Neo4j, data is stored as nodes, relationships, and properties.
#
# - **Nodes**: Entities such as people, products, or places.
# - **Relationships**: Connections between nodes, such as "KNOWS" or "LIKES".
# - **Properties**: Key-value pairs that store information about nodes and relationships.

# ## Creating Nodes


# +
def create_person(tx, name):
    # The CREATE statement is used to create a new node in the database.
    # In this example, we create a node with the label 'Person' and a property 'name'.
    tx.run("CREATE (a:Person {name: $name})", name=name)


def create_node_with_label(tx, label, name):
    # Create a node with a specified label and a property 'name'.
    # The label is provided as a parameter.
    tx.run(f"CREATE (a:{label} {{name: $name}})", name=name)

    # Create a node with multiple labels and a property 'name'.
    # The labels are provided as a list and joined with ':'.
    label_str = ":".join(labels)
    tx.run(f"CREATE (a:{label_str} {{name: $name}})", name=name)

    # Create a node with a specified label and multiple properties.
    # The properties are provided as a dictionary.
    props_str = ", ".join([f"{key}: ${key}" for key in properties.keys()])
    tx.run(f"CREATE (a:{label} {{{props_str}}})", **properties)


def return_created_node(tx, label, name):
    # Create a node with a specified label and a property 'name', then return the created node.
    result = tx.run(f"CREATE (a:{label} {{name: $name}}) RETURN a", name=name)
    return result.single()[0]


# Use the session to write the transactions
