"""
A brief overview of what the script does in one line.

1. Make sure to include the citations here (code and research)
2. Make sure to run the linter on the script before committing changes.
    - Many changes would be pointed out by the linter to maintain consistency
      with coding style.
3. Provide here the reference to the documentation that explains the system in
   detail. (e.g., pycaret.API.md)

This script is how you use (customize) the API in the project. The
naming should be as follows:
 - if the project is on `pycaret`, then it is `pycaret.example.py`

 Follow the reference on coding style guide to write clean and readable code.
