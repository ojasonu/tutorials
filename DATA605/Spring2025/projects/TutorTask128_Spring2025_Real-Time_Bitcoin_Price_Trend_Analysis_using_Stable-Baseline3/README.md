# 📊 Real-Time Bitcoin Price Trend Analysis using Stable-Baselines3

**Difficulty**: Medium (Level 2)  
**Tools**: Stable-Baselines3, Gymnasium, CoinGecko API, Python

---

## 🧠 Description

Stable-Baselines3 is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in Python, designed for performance and ease of use.  
This project applies RL techniques to time series forecasting—specifically, predicting Bitcoin price trends.

By leveraging real-time data ingestion and using **Gymnasium** (a modern replacement for OpenAI Gym), the system aims to analyze and predict Bitcoin price movements using various RL models.

## 🧩 Project Outline

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Collect real-time Bitcoin price data from public APIs (e.g., CoinGecko)
- Preprocess data: handle missing values, normalize features

### 2. **Environment Creation**
- Design a custom Gymnasium environment reflecting Bitcoin’s market dynamics
- Follow Gymnasium API standards for compatibility with RL models

### 3. **RL Model Training**
- Train models using Stable-Baselines3 (e.g., PPO, DQN)
- Tune hyperparameters to optimize learning

### 4. **Prediction and Analysis**
- Use trained model to forecast Bitcoin price movements
- Evaluate performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Customize reward functions to reflect trading performance
- Stress-test models under different simulated market scenarios
